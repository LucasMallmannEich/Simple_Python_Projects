Using Python Module "Random"

Objective:

To practice the Python module "random", using "random.choice(iterable)".

Resolution:

I wrote a code that chooces, randomly, one player among the list of players informed by the user.  
My program also asks the number of players that are going to be appended on the list of players ("list_players").   
The variable "raffled_player" is going to choose one player of the list randomly, using "random.choice(list_players)".  
Finally, it's going to print the name of the chosen one.
