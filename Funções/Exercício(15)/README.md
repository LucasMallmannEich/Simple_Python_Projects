### Analyzing Triangles with Functions

Purpose:
  - Make a program that will receive 3 values (they have to be bigger than zero).         
  - The three values represent the measurements of the three sides of a triangle. Make functions for:                  
  - (a) Determinate if these sides can make a triangle, knowing that:                     
  - The length of each side of a triangle is less than the sum of the other two sides.             
  - (b) Determine and show the type of triangle, if the measurements form a triangle. Specifically:             
  - A triangle with three equal sides is called equilateral;              
  - A triangle with two equal sides is called isosceles;            
  - A triangle with three different sides is called scalene.
