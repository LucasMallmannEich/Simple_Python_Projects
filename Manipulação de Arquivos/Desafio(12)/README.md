## Manipulating Text Files

Purpose:
  - Make a program that opens a text file, calculates and writes the number of characters, the number of lines and the number of words in the file. Besides that, it has to write the number of times each letter appears in the file (ignoring letter with accent mark). Words are separated by one or more characters, space, tabs or new lines.
