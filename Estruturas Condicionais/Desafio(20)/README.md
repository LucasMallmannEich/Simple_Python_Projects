# Using Conditionals Structures for Checking the Sizes of a Triangle           
                 
Proposal:                                                     
Given three values, A, B, C, check if they can be the sides of a triangle.                                                 
And, if they are, determine if the triangle is scalene, equilateral, or isosceles, considering the following concepts:                                                    
The length of each side of a triangle is less than the sum of the other two sides.            
A triangle is called equilateral if it has three equal sides.             
A triangle is called isosceles if it has two sides of equal length.              
A triangle is called scalene if all three sides are different lengths.
